num1 = 13  # NOTICE this num1 was already float (1.3) i figured its mistake so i corrected it into integer 13
num2 = 2.3
num3 = 1j # i dont see a point in this, since its already complex number but ok
num4 = 1.4 
num5 = 1.5
# answers
num1 = float(num1)
num2 = int(num2)
num3 = complex(num3)
num4 = round(num4)
num5 = round(num5)
print(num1, num2, num3, num4, num5)
print(type(num1), type(num2), type(num3), type(num4), type(num5))
